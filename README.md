## Market And Economy Outlook

- December 6, 2023
  
In November, a notable influx of money entered the stock market, sparking discussions about the Federal Reserve potentially lowering rates in the early months of 2024, at least for the first half of the year. Despite the absence of significant changes in market or economic conditions within a month, all stocks experienced a rally, with the S&P500 reaching its previous high point in the summer of 2022. The lowered Consumer Price Index (CPI), influenced by energy prices and decreasing oil costs, contributed to this scenario. However, the potential for an increase in CPI looms, particularly with the expanding conflict in the Middle East.

An intriguing indicator of the stock market's upside is the historical pattern where, during a rally, the Fed intervenes to curb rising rates or slow down the lowering process. Typically, they make public statements or hold conferences to convey a message contrary to the optimistic market sentiment. However, this time, the Fed remained silent while the stock market rallied, prompting a decision to deploy more capital.

Stocks that experienced significant devaluation due to rising rates witnessed a recovery during this period. Additionally, the recent movement in Bitcoin suggested a return of opportunistic players and a resurgence of risk appetite, potentially translating into increased bullish sentiment in the equity market. While the indexes may experience retracement, this sentiment could act as a temporary cushion. Nevertheless, it's crucial to note that this sentiment is pricing in an optimistic scenario, and any disappointment may result in disproportionate downside moves.

The belief that the Fed might contemplate lowering rates in early 2024 hinges on economic conditions, particularly the CPI, which carries a considerable amount of risk. The current market value already incorporates optimism and positive news. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index surged to 2021 levels due to reduced concerns over inflation. However, any negative readings from the labor market or stagnant CPI could pose challenges. Of particular concern is the impending maturity of many commercial real estate loans, especially in the office and multifamily sectors, in the second half of 2024. If higher interest rates persist, it could lead to significant challenges in refinancing, potentially forcing banks to book real losses. Careful consideration of these factors is essential as we navigate the complex landscape of the financial markets.

Q4 Outlook
- October 20, 2023
  
As we approach Q4, the prevailing theme suggests that interest rates will persist at higher levels, influencing financing availability and potentially reshaping asset valuations. A reset in the valuation of high-growth private, VC-funded companies and high-growth earnings-negative public entities is anticipated. The geopolitical landscape, marked by the escalating Israel-Palestine conflict, poses challenges. This conflict may evolve into a larger regional disturbance, disrupting nearby countries' stability, with neutral nations likely to emerge unscathed. Notably, a high correlation between oil prices and Middle East conflicts may contribute to inflation remaining elevated. A rebound in oil prices could trigger higher interest rates and further financial market downturns in the US, potentially impacting global markets. As we navigate these uncertainties and opportunities, strategic positioning and prudent risk management will be paramount for investors.

- October 15, 2023
  
On October 15, my(Boyu) analysis centers on the potential impacts of bond, bank, and Federal Reserve activities on the economy. The Federal Reserve's decision to withdraw the money injected into the economy during the COVID-19 emergency OCE raises concerns about decreased liquidity. Historical patterns on the Fed website indicate that such actions have previously coincided with economic downturns. Notably, the long-term bond market is showing diminished demand, with dealers now forced to buy 60% more compared to the previous 30 years bond (11% to 18%). The recent troubles faced by banks in managing their long-term bonds and liquidity, as evidenced by the SVB, remain unresolved and might not be fully addressed in upcoming earnings reports. The current high bond rates suggest potential selling at a significant discount, amplifying concerns about liquidity, especially considering the surge in bad loans, as seen in recent PNC earnings.

Adding to the economic uncertainties are geopolitical conflicts, particularly the delicate position of the US, with key allies Israel and Ukraine potentially requiring financial support. The upcoming US presidential election adds another layer of complexity. The potential escalation of conflicts and how they are addressed pose significant uncertainties. In such an environment, there's a likelihood of a shift towards safer assets like short-term bonds, driven by both geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties. Consumer demand is perceived to be weaker than in the previous year, compounded by the high energy prices, potentially influenced by Middle East uncertainties. The persistently high energy prices, around 3.7% inflation, pose challenges for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and the overall economy.

Examining the VIX Index, its upward trend reflects the prevailing uncertainty and risks in the economy, intertwined with global issues and the ongoing war. The extreme volatility, with daily price movements of around 5%, indicates that investors and the market are grappling with multifaceted uncertainties, ranging from global issues to inflation, interest rates, and corporate performance. Recent events such as the less-than-successful ARM Instacart IPO and underwhelming bank earnings reports contribute to the overarching uncertainty. The GDP growth also doesn't seem to align well with optimistic projections.

Shifting the focus to September, the FOMC meeting signaled a commitment to maintaining higher interest rates for an extended period, pointing to ongoing economic challenges. This sentiment is further corroborated by airlines offering competitive pricing on plane tickets, exemplified by the relatively low $500 cost for a December flight to Japan. Airlines, being forward-looking entities with substantial fixed costs, can serve as leading indicators for future economic trends, providing valuable insights into consumer demand trends.

H2 2023 Financial Market Analysis

- July 15, 2023
  
In contrast to the outset of 2023, where short-term yields surpassed ultra-short-term and long-term, the current yield curve presents a complete inversion, with all short-term bonds yielding higher than their long-term counterparts. Yields have surged from a peak of 4.7% to 5.4%, influenced by the elevated fed funds rate and persistent inflation. This environment has rendered previously issued bonds with lower coupons unfavorable, leading to a decline in short-term bond prices. While bonds play a relatively smaller role in long-term fund growth, they serve as essential hold-to-maturity securities for constructing portfolios, offering lower volatility and a means to park cash.

With inflation expectations still at 4.6% in April, consumers and employers are anticipated to factor in future rises in food and shelter prices, potentially sustaining high inflation levels. Challenges from categories other than shelter, particularly a surge in rental costs, may momentarily impede shelter price growth. If the hot rental market shows no signs of cooling, inflation is likely to remain high, prompting the Federal Reserve to maintain higher interest rates. Amid strains in commercial real estate refinancing, declining consumer confidence due to deteriorating employment conditions, and potential unseen effects from rapidly rising rates, concerns mount, suggesting a potential hard landing by the end of 2023 or early 2024, coupled with a looming US recession.

Turning to the FX market, the USD is on a downtrend following a twelve-month rally from July 2021 into July 2022. A weakened dollar, potentially down by 3.7%, could boost exports and correlate with higher equity market advancement. This downtrend may signal further potential for a bullish equity market scenario. A softer USD would also benefit foreign stock markets, prompting a strategic selective allocation.

Examining commodities, the CRB has seen a decline since May 2022, with recent price movements indicating a potential bottom as equal highs emerge, avoiding lower lows. Caution is advised, however, as the development of commodities hinges on soft demand from China, whose economic recovery centers around services rather than manufacturing. Copper futures, in a downtrend, struggle to break the previous support-turned-resistance level, making weak commodities susceptible to further downtrends and potentially affecting equity markets.

In the equity market, the SPX has rallied 24% since the November 2023 low, now only 11% below its highest point. Recent resilience, turning resistance into support, raises expectations for further gains. Maintaining this newfound support could propel the SPX to a next price target of 4522, a 5% increase. However, an inability to sustain the new support level may lead to a short-term drawdown of at least 2.4% to the 4196 level. NASDAQ, or IXIC, has emerged from bearish territory, rallying 30% from previous lows but remains 17% below its highest point.

- Jun 10, 2023
  
In the current macroeconomic landscape, there is a discernible shift away from overly optimistic market sentiments, particularly as we approach the year-end. While a short-term bullish trend is anticipated in the equity market for the next 2-3 months, recent market exuberance driven by expectations of the Federal Reserve halting or lowering rates is perceived as unrealistically hopeful. The persistence of inflation around 4%, coupled with heightened consumer inflation expectations, adds a layer of complexity to the economic scenario. The continual increase in shelter costs within the Consumer Price Index (CPI) due to rent escalation further contributes to the nuanced economic environment. The overall health of the U.S. economy is assessed as less robust, with a V-shaped rebound appearing unlikely, at least in the next six months. Additionally, unresolved structural issues tied to government debt present a potential instability factor for financial markets. A note of caution is sounded by the weakened state of the commodity market, prompting a prudent approach for equity investors.

CAVA's core offering revolves around providing nutritious options through customizable pitas and bowls, aligning with the fast-casual format and meeting consumer demands for healthier dining choices. Revenue streams are diversified through physical stores, offering pick-up, drive-through, and dine-in options, as well as consumer packaged goods available in mid-to-high-end retailers, currently exclusive to Whole Foods locations. As a recently IPO-ed company in July 2023, CAVA is garnering attention on Wall Street and is anticipated to sustain double-digit revenue growth over the next five years.

### Tesla
- Jan 24, 2024, on Q4 Earnings

Tesla’s Q4 2023 earnings call was not exactly a magnificent show nor was it a disappointment, more so we consider the earnings call a rather average in its surprises or the lack thereof.

We believe going into the Q4 earnings call, the biggest questions investors want to see regarding the company’s financial performance are the margins and growth, and Tesla’s performance fairly passed the mark to close up 2023 on a relatively healthy note.

**Our high-level summaries and reflections:**

- Q4 automotive revenue was flat YoY, surpassed by the stronger energy and storage segment’s 10% growth as well as the services and others segment’s 27% growth. For FY 23, automobiles were up 15%, energy was up 54%, and services and other revenue were up 37%.
    - Q4 reflected lackluster demand under a high-interest rate environment, illustrating further that price cuts were necessary but not a healthy long-term strategy for the FCF
    - FY 23 demonstrated dampened growth, which means the market would continue to, and justifiably so, price Tesla as a stable growth company for its largest revenue segment—>partially explains for valuation adjustment in LTM
- Q4 revenue inched 3% YoY but gross profit dropped YoY and QoQ with margins at 17.6%, below 23.8% in Q4 2022 as well as Q3 23’s 17.9%. FY 23 revenue is up 19% while gross profit declined 15%, leading to gross margin shrinking significantly by 735 bps. Operating expenses also increased 22% as Tesla continued to invest in product expansion. Operating margin also shrank by 758 bps to 9.2% compared with 2022’s 16.8%.
    - The Q4 as well as FY 23 lackluster profitability illustrate effects mentioned in investor slide decks (lower average selling price and FSD revenue recognition) but perhaps mainly result of price cuts.
    - The operating margin showed signs of reversion, removing some market participants’ concern about Tesla’s long-term margin.
    - Over the last four years, revenue growth from the automotive segment has declined as the overall growth component, dropping from contributing 92% of the growth to 71% from FY 2020 to 2023. Meanwhile, both energy and services continue to increase their share of contribution. Leading to 14.1% for energy and 14.8% for services as compared to 6.7% and 1.2% in FY 2020. We believe as Tesla’s fleet scales, services will continue to take a higher seat of revenue growth contribution until the next generation platform goes into production which is likely in H2 2025 or early 2026. Energy storage will also deliver robust growth based on strong demands.
- CAPEX continues to increase, FY 23 increased 24% YoY. Likewise, cash, cash equivalents, and investments increased 31%.
    - CAPEX increase is expected as the company continues to reinvest. Cash position is growing at a significant pace, fortifying the balance sheet but may also signify a lack of high impact, high ROI projects to take or aggressively add funding into.

**The key takeaways are as follows:**

1. We believe Tesla’s manufacturing capability and expertise, as Elon pointed out, is one of the strongest, counter-cyclical moats. Tesla’s team has not only demonstrated its ability to continuously achieve higher productivity and cost structure efficiency but also consistent incremental and occasional revolutionary improvements in the manufacturing process. We believe this is one of the areas not understood by some analysts to its full extent.
2. The FSD’s capability remains years ahead of OEMs, given the recent updates will further accelerate FSD’s capabilities. This means licensing revenue is a possible supplementary revenue in the future, however, it does not seem like any negotiation is in process as per implied in Elon’s remarks “They don’t believe it is real, yet”.
3. The next-generation platform is key for the next leg of growth. We consider this as a positive sentiment that awaits further confirmation at the official product release event. Elon mentioned the progress is “very far along” (likely a slight underestimation of the actual timeline to bring to market) and revolutionary manufacturing is “far more advanced than any others in the world by a significant margin”.
4. Cybertruck’s demand remains robust with order backlogs.

**Our outlook** aligns with the takeaways’ highlights: while production growth is likely to stagnate at the current level until further ramp-ups in 2024, margins are likely to remain subdued at the current level as well. H1 2024 is likely to stay demand-constrained and face margin pressures but improvements are likely in H2. Medium to long-term, its next-gen platform has the potential to reaccelerate volume and revenue growth into high double digits and supplementary cashflows from the non-automotive segments are expected to deliver a stable growth trajectory at least from FY 24-25. Tesla’s options remain one of the most robust among technology and/or automotive companies whether it is through already well-known possibilities: robotaxi, FSD licensing but also probable avenues: AI inferencing services, Optimus units, manufacturing technique services. Until further materialization toward those supplementary revenue streams, it would remain difficult to forecast or gauge end-market TAMs.

In 2024, we perceive limited upside or positive developments for Tesla. Elon Musk has expressed thoughts about the progress of Dojo, emphasizing that it is currently in line with the plan to utilize NVDA. Despite being a long-term initiative with uncertain outcomes, success in Dojo holds significant potential.

The anticipation for Next Gen, slated for release next year, appears less likely, as Musk has acknowledged the formidable challenges and the necessity for a manufacturing revolution. The Cyber Truck remains a source of uncertainty with the potential for increased margins and demand.

Addressing Full Self-Driving (FSD), there are reservations. Elon Musk has highlighted the impressive performance of Chinese automotive companies, particularly in Europe, where they operate at a Level 3 autonomy comparable to Tesla. Regulatory constraints and restricted testing areas for robo taxis might hinder FSD advancement. Despite Tesla's dominance in data and training, concerns linger regarding Elon's vision of other automakers purchasing FSD licenses.

We recognize a potential market for FSD from Chinese EV manufacturers like Xpeng, Li Auto, or Nio, which could offer competitive pricing. While their FSD capabilities may be at 80%, attractive pricing may still make them appealing to companies like BMW.

From an investor perspective, factors such as the Cyber Truck or lower interest rates may salvage Tesla's prospects. New Gen, a potential game-changer, remains elusive, and achieving previous growth rates is unlikely, as indicated by the CFO. The focus on long-term challenges, rather than short-term issues like interest rates and current market conditions, is noteworthy.

Tesla's demand for the Model Y and Model 3 may have plateaued, as early adopters already own these vehicles. The introduction of NextGen, expected to be more affordable, is crucial to expanding the customer base. Currently, there is a lack of immediate catalysts for growth, with Cyber Truck production anticipated to be slow.

In summary, we project a relatively muted short-term outlook for Tesla in the current fiscal year. While not necessarily negative, we foresee limited upside. The key hope lies in the Cyber Truck, but its production constraints are acknowledged. News of an accelerated Next Gen process or other developments would be instrumental in generating positive momentum. Earnings are not expected to show a significant upside. Optimus Robot and NextGen, representing the next transformative phase for Tesla, appear to be on a more distant horizon, leaving the current demand largely fulfilled by the Model 3 and Model Y.

Lastly, Elon casually gave out an intriguing idea of *using dormant computing power in Tesla’s fleets to run generative AI tasks*. This path has high potential, hey perhaps something is in place for *de-centralized services* (storage, compute, internet).

#### Tesla's Role and the Electric Vehicle Industry in China
In the rapidly evolving landscape of the Chinese electric vehicle (EV) industry, Tesla finds itself navigating a challenging terrain. Despite multiple price reductions, Tesla struggles to establish a clear pricing advantage, particularly when compared to some competitors, notably in the case of the Model 3. Within China, Tesla's vehicles currently operate at Level 2 autonomy for Full Self-Driving (FSD), limiting their usage to highways due to regulatory constraints. The FSD version in China is a scaled-down iteration compared to the U.S., necessitated by the Chinese government's demand for detailed FSD data before approval.

Tesla's operational challenges extend to restricted access, with certain locations, such as government buildings, off-limits due to security considerations. Notably, Chinese EV companies like XPeng have not only focused on manufacturing but also replicated Tesla's entire system, encompassing features like Bluetooth car keys, Sentry Mode, parking functionalities, camera systems, and more.

A standout feature of Chinese EV companies lies in their adeptness at tailoring products to the preferences of the Chinese consumer market. Interiors exude luxury comparable to brands like Mercedes-Benz, incorporating elements like reclining rear seats with massage functions in SUVs. This attention to passenger experience aligns with the prevalence of private drivers in major cities, where labor costs are low.

Chinese EVs boast Level 3 autonomy, surpassing Tesla, and leverage Chinese maps perceived as more accurate than Tesla's proprietary maps. The localized nature of the EV market in China underscores consumers' inclination to support local businesses and products, with regional preferences evident in cities like Guangzhou favoring XPeng and BYD, while Shanghai residents lean towards Tesla.

Tesla's customer base is strategically geared towards a younger demographic, distinguishing itself in the electric vehicle (EV) market. In contrast to other EV manufacturers, particularly in the SUV segment, where the majority of buyers tend to fall within the middle to upper age groups, Tesla's appeal resonates strongly with a younger generation.

Foreseeing challenges for Tesla in the Chinese market, we advocate a strategic shift away from a focus on price cuts. Initially, consumers viewed Tesla as a brand symbolizing new and futuristic ideals, catering to the middle-upper class with products like the Cyber Truck. However, continual price reductions have altered consumer sentiment and brand perception.

To maximize its potential, Tesla should redirect its focus to markets outside China, particularly in Europe and the U.S. The European market, in particular, presents an opportunity for Tesla to leverage its competitive advantage in pricing and FSD capabilities. While acknowledging that Chinese EVs may still find a niche in Europe due to their luxury design, Tesla's favorable pricing positions it as a formidable contender.

In conclusion, Tesla faces intricate challenges in the Chinese EV market, requiring strategic adjustments to regain a foothold. The emphasis should be on enhancing brand perception, targeting specific markets, and capitalizing on Tesla's unique advantages rather than engaging in a price-centric approach.

- Oct 19, 2023, on Q3 Earnings

Tesla is currently at a critical juncture, and this pivotal moment has significant implications for investors, the stock market, and the company's overall strategic decisions.

For investors, Tesla has long been seen as a high-growth, innovative technology company led by Elon Musk. It's been remarkable how Tesla has managed to maintain a high operating margin in the competitive automobile industry. This success can be attributed to several key advantages.

Firstly, the global demand for electric vehicles (EVs) is on the rise, and Tesla has positioned itself as a market leader. The company's Supercharging network provides a significant edge, making long-distance travel convenient for Tesla owners. Furthermore, Elon's diverse ventures, such as Starlink, offer additional sources of revenue and potential synergies.

Perhaps the most significant asset in Tesla's arsenal is the vast amount of data it has collected from its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology. Competing in the autonomous driving space is challenging, as machine learning requires extensive data. With over 5 million miles of FSD beta data, Tesla is miles ahead of its competitors.

Tesla has indeed demonstrated remarkable demand resilience, even in challenging times. However, the current situation presents new uncertainties. To maintain demand, Tesla has found itself continuously reducing prices, including those for Full Self-Driving (FSD) features. This price-cutting strategy has been necessary to keep demand steady.

Historically, demand was never a significant concern for Tesla. However, the landscape may be evolving. The need to continually lower prices indicates that the market dynamics are shifting, and Tesla may be facing new challenges in sustaining its sales momentum. This shift in pricing strategy highlights the company's adaptability in response to evolving market conditions.

However, the recent trend of price reductions is tarnishing Tesla's reputation. Tesla's demand is falling. It's crucial for the company to avoid further price drops, as this could negatively impact its operating margin, which is already at a critical level. Tesla must focus on maintaining or even increasing its operating margin while seeking cost-cutting opportunities.

Tesla's current status is different from the earlier years when it consistently demonstrated growth and innovation. Recent delays in the production of the Cybertruck and Elon Musk's acknowledgment that perpetual 50% growth is unsustainable have raised concerns. He used to be very hopeful about the future of the company. Elon Musk has been talking about the concern with the high interest and that people cannot afford Tesla. This change in tone suggests a more cautious approach to growth.

Additionally, the departure of key personnel like the CFO and AI director hints at internal challenges. Tesla is showing signs of vulnerability in both its growth prospects and margins, leading to a perception that it's in a period of stagnation, lacking potential growth sectors or new opportunities.

In summary, Tesla, once celebrated for its extraordinary growth and innovation, is now grappling with various challenges. Its ability to maintain its operating margin, cease price drops, and find new avenues for growth will be crucial for investors and the company's stock performance. As Tesla navigates this turning point, it faces the complex task of sustaining its unique position in the EV and technology industries.

### Disney
- Nov 14, 2023, on 2023 Q4 Earnings
  
In Disney's Q4 report, a standout achievement was the addition of 7 million subscribers, coupled with a strategic price increase on streaming plans that acted as a positive catalyst, propelling the stock price by an impressive 6.9%. Notably, ESPN+ was separated into its dedicated sports subscription service, reflecting a strategic shift in segment labels for entertainment, sports, and experiences. While the summer months for parks and cruises showed modest quarter-over-quarter growth, there was a slight improvement on a year-over-year basis.

The observed uptick in ads indicates consumer sensitivity to pricing, possibly signaling budget constraints. The free cash flow's remarkable gain of over 100% raises questions about whether this surge can be attributed to restructuring costs. Disney has revised its cost-cutting target from 5.5 billion to 7.5 billion for the year, accompanied by a substantial 30% increase in operating income.

Within the Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) segment, there was a notable turnaround from a -1406 million operating loss last year to a -420 operating loss this quarter, with an optimistic outlook for breakeven in 2024. The earnings call prompted numerous analyst questions, reflecting the street's anxious sentiment regarding the uncertainty of Disney's DTC profitability amid macroeconomic headwinds. International Disney Plus subscribers increased by 11%, while domestic growth was 1%.

Despite prevailing uncertainties, the management conveyed a positive outlook during the earnings call, discussing potential stock buyback programs. Bob Iger anticipates growth and increased profitability next year. Novel approaches, such as a beta version of parent-monitored Disney Plus and initiatives to create more content and enhance ESPN's digital presence, are being considered.

We have a hypothesis, suggesting that Disney's next earnings shouldn't underperform. The analysis advises against Disney emulating Netflix, emphasizing the importance of leveraging its unique advantages. Disney's strength lies in its diverse revenue streams compared to Netflix and its sticky products, particularly in sports and related content channels. Analogous to a brand like Coke, Disney holds a nostalgic and international significance, underscoring the importance of maintaining its content-producing strategy and core values without succumbing to drastic changes that may alienate its loyal viewer base.


- Aug 12, 2023, on 2023 Q3 Earnings

In Disney's Q3 analysis, the decline in cable revenue underscores a sustained downtrend in the cable sector, signaling that streaming has not significantly attracted domestic subscribers. This hints at a potential plateau in streaming growth, primarily propelled by advertising revenue, rendering it vulnerable to macroeconomic downturns. Conversely, international streaming growth appears robust, suggesting a prospective increase in revenue share from the international segment.

On the parks front, reduced merchandising revenue for certain IPs indicates underperformance, impacting the future profitability of associated studio projects with diminished returns on investment. This underscores the pivotal role of studio IPs in influencing merchandising products. Parks also grappled with higher costs and lower volume, reflecting stagnant consumer sentiment compared to the previous year.

Q3 reflects Disney's strategic business restructuring efforts, focusing on enhancing efficiency and restoring creativity through headcount reduction and streamlining management tiers. The associated restructuring charges are likely one-time severance fees, prompting questions about the extent of efficiency gains and whether Disney's margin is already at the industry's top percentile. A critical comparison with platforms like Netflix is imperative to comprehend their strategic approach.

An examination of segments reveals that Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution revenue remained flat with a drop in operating income, emphasizing the need for a turnaround in generating interest in new IPs. Meanwhile, Parks, Experiences, and Products exhibited robust double-digit growth, indicating that growth in the next few years may still primarily emanate from parks until profitability is established in the Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) sector. Recent announcements of new cruise ships align with the continuation of the traditional business model's reinvestment needs.

The growth component of DTC, whether from subscriber increases or plan price hikes, warrants close examination. DTC operating margin improvement on a YoY and QoQ basis suggests a positive trajectory. The decline in cable revenue is attributed to allowed advertising revenue, higher marketing costs, lower average viewership, and rate reductions. Elevated sports programming and production costs coupled with lower affiliate revenue project a stagnant or potentially irrelevant future for ESPN and cable within the next decade.

In tandem, Disney's cruise business is witnessing a significant uplift with the launch of the new ship "Frozen," the first in over a decade. Plans to add two more ships in 2024 and an additional one in 2025 underscore a robust expansion strategy, aiming to double the fleet from four legacy ships to eight. The strategic shift to a one-way cruise ship model aims to broaden appeal and offer flexibility, evident in the remarkable 98% capacity booking for the next quarter. Cruise ship revenue has surpassed expectations, aligning with the success of their park business. Despite economic uncertainties, the cruise ship's relatively affordable prices position it as an attractive and resilient option. Disney's strong hospitality reputation, akin to their parks, reinforces the cruise experience as a unique and indispensable offering, not a mere substitute product.

On the streaming front, Disney is exploring new avenues, evident in the strong demand for annual memberships for Disney parks. The consideration of diverse pricing models and loyalty programs, along with exploring an all-inclusive streaming bundle and addressing account-sharing challenges with tiered models, underscores a forward-thinking approach. However, despite a positive Q3 earnings performance and a modest stock increase, investors are eager to witness substantial growth in streaming and Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) channels. Despite minimal growth, with subscribers increasing by only 1% over the quarter, the synergy between successful parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong and the cruise business showcases the potential of a combined park and cruise offering. While international traveler volume is rising, it has yet to fully recover to 2019 levels, presenting both challenges and opportunities for Disney's global operations.
