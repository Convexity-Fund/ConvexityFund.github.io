H2 2023 Financial Market Analysis
- July 15, 2023
In contrast to the outset of 2023, where short-term yields surpassed ultra-short-term and long-term, the current yield curve presents a complete inversion, with all short-term bonds yielding higher than their long-term counterparts. Yields have surged from a peak of 4.7% to 5.4%, influenced by the elevated fed funds rate and persistent inflation. This environment has rendered previously issued bonds with lower coupons unfavorable, leading to a decline in short-term bond prices. While bonds play a relatively smaller role in long-term fund growth, they serve as essential hold-to-maturity securities for constructing portfolios, offering lower volatility and a means to park cash.

With inflation expectations still at 4.6% in April, consumers and employers are anticipated to factor in future rises in food and shelter prices, potentially sustaining high inflation levels. Challenges from categories other than shelter, particularly a surge in rental costs, may momentarily impede shelter price growth. If the hot rental market shows no signs of cooling, inflation is likely to remain high, prompting the Federal Reserve to maintain higher interest rates. Amid strains in commercial real estate refinancing, declining consumer confidence due to deteriorating employment conditions, and potential unseen effects from rapidly rising rates, concerns mount, suggesting a potential hard landing by the end of 2023 or early 2024, coupled with a looming US recession.

Turning to the FX market, the USD is on a downtrend following a twelve-month rally from July 2021 into July 2022. A weakened dollar, potentially down by 3.7%, could boost exports and correlate with higher equity market advancement. This downtrend may signal further potential for a bullish equity market scenario. A softer USD would also benefit foreign stock markets, prompting a strategic selective allocation.

Examining commodities, the CRB has seen a decline since May 2022, with recent price movements indicating a potential bottom as equal highs emerge, avoiding lower lows. Caution is advised, however, as the development of commodities hinges on soft demand from China, whose economic recovery centers around services rather than manufacturing. Copper futures, in a downtrend, struggle to break the previous support-turned-resistance level, making weak commodities susceptible to further downtrends and potentially affecting equity markets.

In the equity market, the SPX has rallied 24% since the November 2023 low, now only 11% below its highest point. Recent resilience, turning resistance into support, raises expectations for further gains. Maintaining this newfound support could propel the SPX to a next price target of 4522, a 5% increase. However, an inability to sustain the new support level may lead to a short-term drawdown of at least 2.4% to the 4196 level. NASDAQ, or IXIC, has emerged from bearish territory, rallying 30% from previous lows but remains 17% below its highest point.

Q4 Outlook
- October 15, 2023
As we approach Q4, the prevailing theme suggests that interest rates will persist at higher levels, influencing financing availability and potentially reshaping asset valuations. A reset in the valuation of high-growth private, VC-funded companies and high-growth earnings-negative public entities is anticipated. The geopolitical landscape, marked by the escalating Israel-Palestine conflict, poses challenges. This conflict may evolve into a larger regional disturbance, disrupting nearby countries' stability, with neutral nations likely to emerge unscathed. Notably, a high correlation between oil prices and Middle East conflicts may contribute to inflation remaining elevated. A rebound in oil prices could trigger higher interest rates and further financial market downturns in the US, potentially impacting global markets. As we navigate these uncertainties and opportunities, strategic positioning and prudent risk management will be paramount for investors.

- October 15, 2023
On October 15, my(Boyu) analysis centers on the potential impacts of bond, bank, and Federal Reserve activities on the economy. The Federal Reserve's decision to withdraw the money injected into the economy during the COVID-19 emergency OCE raises concerns about decreased liquidity. Historical patterns on the Fed website indicate that such actions have previously coincided with economic downturns. Notably, the long-term bond market is showing diminished demand, with dealers now forced to buy 60% more compared to the previous 30 years bond (11% to 18%). The recent troubles faced by banks in managing their long-term bonds and liquidity, as evidenced by the SVB, remain unresolved and might not be fully addressed in upcoming earnings reports. The current high bond rates suggest potential selling at a significant discount, amplifying concerns about liquidity, especially considering the surge in bad loans, as seen in recent PNC earnings.

Adding to the economic uncertainties are geopolitical conflicts, particularly the delicate position of the US, with key allies Israel and Ukraine potentially requiring financial support. The upcoming US presidential election adds another layer of complexity. The potential escalation of conflicts and how they are addressed pose significant uncertainties. In such an environment, there's a likelihood of a shift towards safer assets like short-term bonds, driven by both geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties. Consumer demand is perceived to be weaker than in the previous year, compounded by the high energy prices, potentially influenced by Middle East uncertainties. The persistently high energy prices, around 3.7% inflation, pose challenges for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and the overall economy.

Examining the VIX Index, its upward trend reflects the prevailing uncertainty and risks in the economy, intertwined with global issues and the ongoing war. The extreme volatility, with daily price movements of around 5%, indicates that investors and the market are grappling with multifaceted uncertainties, ranging from global issues to inflation, interest rates, and corporate performance. Recent events such as the less-than-successful ARM Instacart IPO and underwhelming bank earnings reports contribute to the overarching uncertainty. The GDP growth also doesn't seem to align well with optimistic projections.

Shifting the focus to September, the FOMC meeting signaled a commitment to maintaining higher interest rates for an extended period, pointing to ongoing economic challenges. This sentiment is further corroborated by airlines offering competitive pricing on plane tickets, exemplified by the relatively low $500 cost for a December flight to Japan. Airlines, being forward-looking entities with substantial fixed costs, can serve as leading indicators for future economic trends, providing valuable insights into consumer demand trends.

- Jun 10, 2023
In the current macroeconomic landscape, there is a discernible shift away from overly optimistic market sentiments, particularly as we approach the year-end. While a short-term bullish trend is anticipated in the equity market for the next 2-3 months, recent market exuberance driven by expectations of the Federal Reserve halting or lowering rates is perceived as unrealistically hopeful. The persistence of inflation around 4%, coupled with heightened consumer inflation expectations, adds a layer of complexity to the economic scenario. The continual increase in shelter costs within the Consumer Price Index (CPI) due to rent escalation further contributes to the nuanced economic environment. The overall health of the U.S. economy is assessed as less robust, with a V-shaped rebound appearing unlikely, at least in the next six months. Additionally, unresolved structural issues tied to government debt present a potential instability factor for financial markets. A note of caution is sounded by the weakened state of the commodity market, prompting a prudent approach for equity investors.

### Company Outlook 

#### Tesla
- Oct 19, 2023, on Q3 Earnings

Tesla is currently at a critical juncture, and this pivotal moment has significant implications for investors, the stock market, and the company's overall strategic decisions.

For investors, Tesla has long been seen as a high-growth, innovative technology company led by Elon Musk. It's been remarkable how Tesla has managed to maintain a high operating margin in the competitive automobile industry. This success can be attributed to several key advantages.

Firstly, the global demand for electric vehicles (EVs) is on the rise, and Tesla has positioned itself as a market leader. The company's Supercharging network provides a significant edge, making long-distance travel convenient for Tesla owners. Furthermore, Elon's diverse ventures, such as Starlink, offer additional sources of revenue and potential synergies.

Perhaps the most significant asset in Tesla's arsenal is the vast amount of data it has collected from its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology. Competing in the autonomous driving space is challenging, as machine learning requires extensive data. With over 5 million miles of FSD beta data, Tesla is miles ahead of its competitors.

Tesla has indeed demonstrated remarkable demand resilience, even in challenging times. However, the current situation presents new uncertainties. To maintain demand, Tesla has found itself continuously reducing prices, including those for Full Self-Driving (FSD) features. This price-cutting strategy has been necessary to keep demand steady.

Historically, demand was never a significant concern for Tesla. However, the landscape may be evolving. The need to continually lower prices indicates that the market dynamics are shifting, and Tesla may be facing new challenges in sustaining its sales momentum. This shift in pricing strategy highlights the company's adaptability in response to evolving market conditions.

However, the recent trend of price reductions is tarnishing Tesla's reputation. Tesla's demand is falling. It's crucial for the company to avoid further price drops, as this could negatively impact its operating margin, which is already at a critical level. Tesla must focus on maintaining or even increasing its operating margin while seeking cost-cutting opportunities.

Tesla's current status is different from the earlier years when it consistently demonstrated growth and innovation. Recent delays in the production of the Cybertruck and Elon Musk's acknowledgment that perpetual 50% growth is unsustainable have raised concerns. He used to be very hopeful about the future of the company. Elon Musk has been talking about the concern with the high interest and that people cannot afford Tesla. This change in tone suggests a more cautious approach to growth.

Additionally, the departure of key personnel like the CFO and AI director hints at internal challenges. Tesla is showing signs of vulnerability in both its growth prospects and margins, leading to a perception that it's in a period of stagnation, lacking potential growth sectors or new opportunities.

In summary, Tesla, once celebrated for its extraordinary growth and innovation, is now grappling with various challenges. Its ability to maintain its operating margin, cease price drops, and find new avenues for growth will be crucial for investors and the company's stock performance. As Tesla navigates this turning point, it faces the complex task of sustaining its unique position in the EV and technology industries.

#### Disney
- Nov 14, 2023, on 2023 Q4 Earnings
  
In Disney's Q4 report, a standout achievement was the addition of 7 million subscribers, coupled with a strategic price increase on streaming plans that acted as a positive catalyst, propelling the stock price by an impressive 6.9%. Notably, ESPN+ was separated into its dedicated sports subscription service, reflecting a strategic shift in segment labels for entertainment, sports, and experiences. While the summer months for parks and cruises showed modest quarter-over-quarter growth, there was a slight improvement on a year-over-year basis.

The observed uptick in ads indicates consumer sensitivity to pricing, possibly signaling budget constraints. The free cash flow's remarkable gain of over 100% raises questions about whether this surge can be attributed to restructuring costs. Disney has revised its cost-cutting target from 5.5 billion to 7.5 billion for the year, accompanied by a substantial 30% increase in operating income.

Within the Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) segment, there was a notable turnaround from a -1406 million operating loss last year to a -420 operating loss this quarter, with an optimistic outlook for breakeven in 2024. The earnings call prompted numerous analyst questions, reflecting the street's anxious sentiment regarding the uncertainty of Disney's DTC profitability amid macroeconomic headwinds. International Disney Plus subscribers increased by 11%, while domestic growth was 1%.

Despite prevailing uncertainties, the management conveyed a positive outlook during the earnings call, discussing potential stock buyback programs. Bob Iger anticipates growth and increased profitability next year. Novel approaches, such as a beta version of parent-monitored Disney Plus and initiatives to create more content and enhance ESPN's digital presence, are being considered.

We have a hypothesis, suggesting that Disney's next earnings shouldn't underperform. The analysis advises against Disney emulating Netflix, emphasizing the importance of leveraging its unique advantages. Disney's strength lies in its diverse revenue streams compared to Netflix and its sticky products, particularly in sports and related content channels. Analogous to a brand like Coke, Disney holds a nostalgic and international significance, underscoring the importance of maintaining its content-producing strategy and core values without succumbing to drastic changes that may alienate its loyal viewer base.


- Aug 12, 2023, on 2023 Q3 Earnings

In Disney's Q3 analysis, the decline in cable revenue underscores a sustained downtrend in the cable sector, signaling that streaming has not significantly attracted domestic subscribers. This hints at a potential plateau in streaming growth, primarily propelled by advertising revenue, rendering it vulnerable to macroeconomic downturns. Conversely, international streaming growth appears robust, suggesting a prospective increase in revenue share from the international segment.

On the parks front, reduced merchandising revenue for certain IPs indicates underperformance, impacting the future profitability of associated studio projects with diminished returns on investment. This underscores the pivotal role of studio IPs in influencing merchandising products. Parks also grappled with higher costs and lower volume, reflecting stagnant consumer sentiment compared to the previous year.

Q3 reflects Disney's strategic business restructuring efforts, focusing on enhancing efficiency and restoring creativity through headcount reduction and streamlining management tiers. The associated restructuring charges are likely one-time severance fees, prompting questions about the extent of efficiency gains and whether Disney's margin is already at the industry's top percentile. A critical comparison with platforms like Netflix is imperative to comprehend their strategic approach.

An examination of segments reveals that Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution revenue remained flat with a drop in operating income, emphasizing the need for a turnaround in generating interest in new IPs. Meanwhile, Parks, Experiences, and Products exhibited robust double-digit growth, indicating that growth in the next few years may still primarily emanate from parks until profitability is established in the Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) sector. Recent announcements of new cruise ships align with the continuation of the traditional business model's reinvestment needs.

The growth component of DTC, whether from subscriber increases or plan price hikes, warrants close examination. DTC operating margin improvement on a YoY and QoQ basis suggests a positive trajectory. The decline in cable revenue is attributed to allowed advertising revenue, higher marketing costs, lower average viewership, and rate reductions. Elevated sports programming and production costs coupled with lower affiliate revenue project a stagnant or potentially irrelevant future for ESPN and cable within the next decade.

In tandem, Disney's cruise business is witnessing a significant uplift with the launch of the new ship "Frozen," the first in over a decade. Plans to add two more ships in 2024 and an additional one in 2025 underscore a robust expansion strategy, aiming to double the fleet from four legacy ships to eight. The strategic shift to a one-way cruise ship model aims to broaden appeal and offer flexibility, evident in the remarkable 98% capacity booking for the next quarter. Cruise ship revenue has surpassed expectations, aligning with the success of their park business. Despite economic uncertainties, the cruise ship's relatively affordable prices position it as an attractive and resilient option. Disney's strong hospitality reputation, akin to their parks, reinforces the cruise experience as a unique and indispensable offering, not a mere substitute product.

On the streaming front, Disney is exploring new avenues, evident in the strong demand for annual memberships for Disney parks. The consideration of diverse pricing models and loyalty programs, along with exploring an all-inclusive streaming bundle and addressing account-sharing challenges with tiered models, underscores a forward-thinking approach. However, despite a positive Q3 earnings performance and a modest stock increase, investors are eager to witness substantial growth in streaming and Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) channels. Despite minimal growth, with subscribers increasing by only 1% over the quarter, the synergy between successful parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong and the cruise business showcases the potential of a combined park and cruise offering. While international traveler volume is rising, it has yet to fully recover to 2019 levels, presenting both challenges and opportunities for Disney's global operations.

### Trading Opportunity

#### Nio
- June 12, 2023
  
In June 2023, amidst a broader market rally in top technology stocks, we identified a compelling investment opportunity in NIO. Anticipating a short-term market rally within 2-3 months, while the long-term outlook remained uncertain, we closely monitored the EV sector(We are long-term Tesla Investors). Notably, most automotive stocks, including NIO, exhibited a similar technical graph, with major companies experiencing a growth of around 20%. Recognizing a prevalent pattern of testing bottoms, moving between short and long-term EMAs, and breaking through trends followed by significant gains, we employed Python and statistical modeling for analysis. Against the backdrop of China's increased money supply, lower interest rates, and a 1 trillion yuan issuance to local governments, we perceived positive signals for NIO's short-term growth. We predict that the short-term market rally will shift from the top 7 tech stocks to other stocks, amplifying the potential for NIO's catch-up during this period. Opting for a short-term investment approach of 1-2 months and bypassing fundamental analysis, we identified a strong correlation between NIO, XPEV, and Li. While XPEV increased by 17% and Li by 71%, NIO experienced a lag with a negative 20%, suggesting a promising opportunity for short-term gains. Key catalysts included low relative performance but a high correlation with comparable stocks, coupled with China's rate cuts incentivizing spending and a lowered price point.
